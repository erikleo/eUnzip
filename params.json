{"name":"eUnzip","tagline":"The fastest and easiest way to unzip downloads","body":"### Purpose\r\neUnzip removes the frustration and wasted time when unzipping files, by doing the things automatically that should have been done in the first place\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nBy simply right clicking on a zip file and using “send to” -> eUnzip.exe the program will do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Unzip the file\r\n    - If the zip is a bunch of files it will create a folder and put the files in it (removing the possibility of accidental filling your desktop with files all over the place)\r\n    - If the zip is a single folder or file it will just unzip it and not create an extra folder, you don’t need\r\n1. Delete the original zip file. (which you don’t need anymore)\r\n\r\n### Author Note\r\n\r\nI find people almost always want the unzipping process to work this way but every unzip program I found does not do it, so I made one that does.  Enjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
