{"name":"eUnzip","tagline":"The fastest and easiest way to unzip downloads","body":"### Purpose\r\neUnzip removes the frustration and wasted time when unzipping files, by doing the things automatically that should have been done in the first place\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nBy simply right clicking on a zip file and using “send to” -> eUnzip.exe the program will do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Unzip the file\r\n    - If the zip is a bunch of files it will create a folder and put the files in it (removing the possibility of accidental filling your desktop with files all over the place)\r\n    - If the zip is a single folder or file it will just unzip it and not create an extra folder, you don’t need\r\n1. Delete the original zip file. (which you don’t need anymore)\r\n\r\n### Directions\r\n1. Download eUnzip.exe and save it to disk\r\n1. Copy eUnzip to the windows \"Send To\" folder\r\n    - To find this folder try the shortcut \"Windows Key-> R\" \r\n    - Then type the following in the run box: \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SendTo\\\"\r\n1. Once the file is copied, all you need to do is right click on a zip file then choose \"Send To\", then \"eUzip.exe\" and the program will unzip the file for you without creating any clutter.\r\n\r\n### Author Note\r\n\r\nI find people almost always want the unzipping process to work this way but every unzip program I found does not do it, so I made one that does.
